## Get started

[Get the latest version of BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases), or pick a [different release](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases). Copy it to your Applications folder and run it - it will ask you to (create and) elect a plugins folder, do so.

Homebrew Cask users can, alternatively, install BitBar by running `brew cask install bitbar`.

[Browse our plugins](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/tree/master/Plugins) to find useful scripts, or [write your own](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/tree/master/Plugins#write-your-own)

## It's free, so please donate

If you love this, any BitCoin donations are most welcome, to `1DGoNEYAnjE5DqK7y5zMPR4PLU5HLKpLNR` or [send something useful (Amazon Wishlist)](http://amzn.to/1Pd9yOt).

## Installing plugins

Just download the plugin of your choice into your BitBar plugins directory and choose 'Reset' from one of the BitBar menus. 

### Configure the refresh time

The refresh time is in the filename of the plugin, following this format:

    {name}.{time}.{ext}

  * `name` - The name of the file
  * `time` - The refresh rate (see below)
  * `ext` - The file extension

For example:

  * `date.1m.sh` would refresh every minute.

Most plugins will come with a default, but you can change it to anything you like:

  * 10s - ten seconds
  * 1m - one minute
  * 2h - two hours
  * 1d - a day

### Ensure you have execution rights

Ensure the plugin is executable by running `chmod +x plugin.sh`.

#### Resetting Plugin Directory

In case you made the mistake of choosing a directory with thousands of files as the plugin directory and BitBar getting stuck forever, do this from terminal to reset it:

`defaults delete com.matryer.BitBar`
